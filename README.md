## 🔖 Featured Projects

### 🔍 [RAG-Based Chatbot](https://github.com/muskaand26/chatbot)
Built a document-aware chatbot using LangChain and FAISS. Combined BM25 + embeddings for hybrid retrieval, improving response accuracy by 35%.

### 🎵 [Emotion-Based Music Recommender](https://github.com/muskaand26/emotion-music-recommender)
Real-time emotion detection using CNN + OpenCV. Recommends music based on facial expressions.

### 🩸 [Blood Donation Web App](https://blooddonationsystemju.netlify.app/)
React + LLM integration for smart donor-recipient matching. Reduced search time from 48 hrs to 12 hrs for 500+ users.
